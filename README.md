# Olympics 2024 Medal Analysis

This project analyses the medal standings from the 2024 Olympics to uncover trends and insights into national athletic performance. Using Python, SQL, and Excel, I cleaned, explored, and queried the dataset to provide actionable information that could assist sports analysts, journalists, and Olympic organisers in understanding country performances and medal distribution.

## Project Overview

This project involves processing and analysing the 2024 Olympics medal standings. The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and validation using **Python (Pandas)** and **Excel**  
- SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and aggregation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualisations in **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Clear documentation and data dictionary for easy understanding   

**Goal:** To understand medal distributions and highlight countries excelling at the games.

## Dataset
**File**: `olympics2024.csv`

| Column       | Description                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Rank         | Country's rank by total medals |
| Country      | Country name                   |
| Country_Code | Country abbreviation/code      |
| Gold         | Number of gold medals          |
| Silver       | Number of silver medals        |
| Bronze       | Number of bronze medals        |
| Total        | Total medals earned            |

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Tools used:  
- **Excel:** Initial data inspection, removing duplicates, filtering, formatting  
- **Python (Pandas):** In-depth cleaning, handling missing values, exporting cleaned dataset  

```python
# Import Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("olympics2024.csv")

# Quick data exploration
print(df.head())
print(df.isnull().sum())
print(df.dtypes)
print(df.duplicated().sum())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

# Drop duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Save cleaned data
df.to_csv("olympics2024_cleaned.csv", index=False)

```
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Jupyter Notebook olympics_analysis.ipynb contains:
- Summary statistics
- Distribution charts (histograms, bar charts)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Insights with markdown commentary
These visualisations demonstrate data storytelling and exploration.

## SQL Analysis

Created a MySQL database to perform queries on the cleaned dataset.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE olympics;
USE olympics;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS olympics_medals (
    `Rank` INT,
    Country VARCHAR(250),
    Country_Code VARCHAR(10),
    Gold INT,
    Silver INT,
    Bronze INT,
    Total INT
);

```
## Questions

**Question 1: Top Performing Countries with 10+ Medals**

```sql
SELECT Country, Country_Code, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total
FROM olympics_medals
WHERE Total >= 10
ORDER BY Total DESC;
```
**Question 2: Countries with 5+ Gold Medals**

```sql
SELECT Country, Gold, Total
FROM olympics_medals
WHERE Gold >= 5
ORDER BY Gold DESC;
```

**Question 3: Group Medals by Country**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
SELECT Country,
       SUM(Gold) AS Total_Gold,
       SUM(Silver) AS Total_Silver,
       SUM(Bronze) AS Total_Bronze,
       SUM(Total) AS Grand_Total
FROM olympics_medals
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Grand_Total DESC;
```

## Visualisations

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

top_countries = df[df['Total'] >= 10].sort_values('Total', ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.bar(top_countries['Country'], top_countries['Total'], color='gold')
plt.title('Countries with 10 or More Medals')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Total Medals')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
The chart image is saved at images/10_plus_medals_chart.png.


## Key Findings
- 12 countries earned 10 or more medals; top 5 countries accounted for over 50% of all medals.
- Countries with 5+ gold medals generally have high total medal counts, indicating strong athletic programs.
- Medal distribution is highly concentrated among a small group of nations.
- 
## Business Context

The Olympic Committee aims to understand medal distribution among countries to optimise funding and media coverage. This analysis highlights leading nations and concentration patterns to support strategic decisions.

## Limitations & Assumptions

- Dataset contains only medal counts by country, no athlete-level data.
- Medal counts reflect final standings at data collection time; may not include later updates.
- Assumes country codes follow ISO Alpha-3 standard without exceptions

## What I learned
- Advanced data cleaning and validation techniques with Pandas and Excel
- Writing efficient SQL queries for aggregation and filtering
- Creating meaningful visualisations to communicate complex data
- Importance of dataset and code documentation for reproducibility
